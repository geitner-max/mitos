# Mitos

Mitos is a library and a tool for collecting sampled memory
performance data to view with
[MemAxes](https://github.com/scalability-llnl/MemAxes)

----

# Quick Start

## Requirements

Mitos requires:

* A Linux kernel with perf_events support for memory
  sampling.  This originated in the 3.10 Linux kernel, but is backported
  to some versions of [RHEL6.6](https://www.redhat.com/promo/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux6/).

* [Dyninst](http://www.dyninst.org) version 8.2 or higher.

* [hwloc](http://www.open-mpi.org/projects/hwloc/)

## Building

1. Make sure that Dyninst is installed and its location is added to the
   `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` environment variable.

2. Run the following commands from the root of the MemAxes source:
   ```
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install/location ..
   make
   make install
   ```

## Running

### Mitosrun

1. Find the `mitosrun` command in the `bin` directory in the install
   directory.

2. Run any binary with `mitosrun` like this to generate a folder of
   mitos output data. For example:

   ```
   mitosrun ./examples/matmul
   ```

   The above command will run the matmul example and create a folder
   called mitos_###, where ### is the number of seconds since the
   epoch. The folder will contain:

   ```
   mitos_###/
      data/
         samples.csv
      src/
         <empty>
      hardware.xml
   ```

   Where `samples.csv` contains a comma-separated list of memory
   samples, hardware.xml describes the hardware topology (using hwloc)
   and src is an empty directory where you can put the program source
   files for use in MemAxes.

   `mitosrun` can also be fine-tuned with the following parameters:

   ```
   [options]:
       -b sample buffer size (default 4096)
       -p sample period (default 4000)
       -t sample latency threshold (default 10)
   ```

## IBS Configuration
1. Configure CMAKE with IBS depending on the chosen executable and configure environment variables if necessary:
* `IBS_TYPE` 
  * Use IBS_FETCH or IBS_OP depending on the profiling use case (requires AMD processor with IBS support)
  * IBS is not supported on Intel processors, therefore set variable to OFF
* `IBS_SAMPLING_MODE`
  * Mitosrun (with or without OpenMP): `IBS_ALL_ON` or `IBS_THREAD_MIGRATION`
  * Mitoshooks with OpenMP: 
    * `IBS_THREAD_MIGRATION`, requires Clang due to omp-tools.h dependency
    * Enables OpenMP code by setting `MITOSHOOKS_OPEN_MP` CMake variable to `ON`
    * Configure environment variable `OMP_TOOL_LIBRARIES` that points to mitoshooks-library:
      * OMP_TOOL_LIBRARIES=./../src/libmitoshooks.so
  * Mitoshooks with MPI: `IBS_THREAD_MIGRATION`
  * NOTE: `IBS_ALL_ON` might also work, but this sampling method is not recommended.

## Mitoshooks with OpenMP Usage
1. Requirements
   * Compiler with OMPT support such as Clang (OpenMP feature since version 5.0)
2. CMake Configuration
   * OpenMP found
   * `MITOSHOOKS_OPEN_MP`: ON
3. Compilation
   * Compilation of Mitoshooks library
   * Compilation of OpenMP-application
4. Execution
   * Configuration of environment variable `OMP_TOOL_LIBRARIES` that points to mitoshooks-library:
       * e.g. for omp_example.cpp: OMP_TOOL_LIBRARIES=./../src/libmitoshooks.so
   * Launch OpenMP-application
     * ./omp_example
